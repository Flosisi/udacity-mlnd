# Udacity - Machine Learning Nano Degree (MLND)

After I have completed my <a href="https://github.com/Flosisi/udacity-ipnd">IPND</a>, I decided to learn further in AI field.
My next step is to continue to learn with Udacity for Machine Learning, to later then study further in one of the specialisation.
This is a 1 term 6-months long program, which I am currently doing since April 2018 until expected graduation date on October 2018.
In this program, I've learned the following modules and created projects related to those topics.
<br>
<br>

## Stage 0: Machine Learning Foundation
Key learning: Overview on various main algorithms that are used in Machine Learning.
<br>**Tools:** Python, NumPy, Pandas
<br>**Algorithm**: Overview of Decision Tress, Naive Bayes, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, 
<br>Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks, Kernel Method, K-Means Clustering, Hirearchical Clustering.
<br>**Project:** <a href="https://github.com/Flosisi/udacity-mlnd/tree/master/P1%20MLND%20-%20titanic_survival_exploration">Exploring the Titanic Survival Data</a>
<br>

## Stage 1: Model Evaluation and Validation
Key learnings: Selections of methods and metrics to approach the following questions: 
- How do we train a model?
- How do we know if the model is good?
- How do I improve this model?
