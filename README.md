# Udacity - Machine Learning Nanodegree (MLND)

In this program, I will build Machine Learning models using various algorithms in supervised and supervised learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning on data sets in fields like finance, healthcare, education, and
more. This is a 1 term program that is spread over 6 months. Estimated time required to complete this nanodegree is 200 hours.

## Introduction

## Model Evaluation and Validation

## Supervised Learning
Learn how Supervised Learning models such as Decision Trees, SVMs, etc. are trained to model and predict labeled data.

## Unsupervised Learning
Learn how to find patterns and structures in unlabeled data, perform feature transformations and improve the predictive performance of your models.

## Deep Learning
TensorFlow, Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Reinforcement Learning
Use Reinforcement Learning algorithms like Q-Learning to train artificial agents to take optimal actions in an environment.

## Capstone project
Create machine learning models that can be applied to a problem in the real world.
